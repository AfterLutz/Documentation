## Akkatecture is a cqrs and event sourcing framework for dotnet core.
Akkatecture is an open source dotnet framework, for building reactive microservice systems. Akkatecture is built on top
of akka.net, and the principles of the actor model. The framework subscribes to the tenets of cqrs, event sourcing, and
asynchronous message passing so that you can be sure that your application is:

 - reactive.
 - distributed.
 - event sourced.
 - scalable.

Akkatecture treats event sourcing, and the axioms of the actor model as a primary fundamental concept. As a result of
being built on top of akka.net, Akkatecture also enjoys great levels of extensibility, and configurability, so that you
can make a resilient, but also distributed application.

## Getting Started
Akkatecture is written in .net core targeting the netstandard 2.0 framework, while also using the greatest and latest open source dotnet core technologies.
If you are familiar with domain driven design, cqrs, and event sourcing, then learning Akkatecture will be a breeze. If you are not, don't worry, why not learn these concepts while using Akkatecture through our walkthrough style tutorial in our documentation.
This project comes complete with documentation that covers the concepts and constructs that it prescribes.
