The basic core primitives of Akkatecture are:

- [Value Objects](#value-objects)
- [Identities](#identities)
- [Entities](#entities)

A `ValueObject` is an immutable type that is distinguishable only by the state of its properties. That is, unlike an `Entity`, which has a unique identifier and remains distinct even if its properties are otherwise identical, two `ValueObject`s with the exact same properties can be considered equal. An `Entity` always has a globally unique identifier, that is, if two entities have the same identity, they are the same entity, regardless if their member values are different. Akkatecture uses these primitives all over the project, and you are highly encouraged to use them as well, so that your domain design is highly expressive, and readable.

# Value Objects

In Akkatecture, the `ValueObject` abstract class type is used to represent value object. These should be immutable by implementation. There also is the `SingleValueObject<>` generic primitive, that allows for the modelling of domain value objects that are only valued by a single c# dotnet primitive.

```csharp
public class AccountNumber : SingleValueObject<string>
{
  public AccountNumber(string value)
    : base(value)
  {
      //do some model validation, null checks etc.
  }
}
```
>It is recommended to use `value` as the parameter name, if you intend to serialize value objects. With Akkatecture's built in serialization converters.

# Identities

The `Identity<>` value object provides generic functionality to model and validate the identities of e.g. aggregate roots. Its esentially a wrapper around a `Guid`. It is possible to model your own `Identity<>` by implementing the `IIdentity<>` interface.

```csharp
public class AccountId : Identity<AccountId>
{
  public AccountId(string value)
    : base(value)
  {
  }
}
```

1. The identity follow the form `{class without "Id"}-{guid}` e.g. `account-c93fdb8c-5c9a-4134-bbcd-87c0644ca34f` for the above `AccountId` example.

2. The internal `Guid` can be generated using one of the following methods/properties as described by points 3-5 on this list. You can access the `Guid` factories directly by accessing the static methods on the `GuidFactories` class.

3. `New`: Uses the standard `Guid.NewGuid()`.

4.  `NewDeterministic(...)`: Creates a name-based `Guid` using the algorithm from [RFC 4122 §4.3](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt), which allows identities to be generated based on known data, e.g. an e-mail, i.e., it always returns the same identity for the same arguments.

5.  `NewComb()`: Creates a sequential `Guid` that can be used to e.g. avoid database fragmentation.

6.  A `string` can be tested to see if its a valid identity using the static `bool IsValid(string)` method.

7.  Any validation errors can be gathered using the static `IEnumerable<string> Validate(string)` method.

>    Its very important to name the constructor argument `value` as it is significant when the identity type is deserialized.


Here's some examples on we can use our newly created `AccountId`

```csharp
// Uses the default Guid.NewGuid()
// as described in point 3 above
var accountId = AccountId.New
```

```csharp
// Create a namespace, put this in a constant somewhere
var emailNamespace = Guid.Parse("769077C6-F84D-46E3-AD2E-828A576AAAF3");

// Creates an identity with the value "account-9181a444-af25-567e-a866-c263b6f6119a",
// useful to use when you want to create Id's
// deterministically from other real world "identifiers",
// especially in distributed situations
// as described in point 4 above
var accountId = AccountId.NewDeterministic(emailNamespace, "test@example.com");
```

```csharp
// Creates a new identity every time, but an identity when used in e.g.
// database indexes, minimizes fragmentation
// as described in point 5 above
var accountId = AccountId.NewComb()
```

> You are not forced to use the `Identity<>` implementation from Akkatecture. If you make your own Identity that implements `IIdentity` then it can still plug into all of the Akkatecture constructs as variants.

# Entities

An `Entity` is an object that has some intrinsic identity, apart from the rest of its state. Even if its properties are the same as another instance of the same type, it remains distinct because of its unique identity. The `Entity<>` In Akkatecture is itself a `ValueObject` however it implements the `IEntity<Identity>` interface, which requires it to have a member called `Identity Id`. Now you can see the relationship between `Entity<>`, `SingleValueObject<>`, and `Identity<>`. A sample `Entity` running onwards from the Account example above, could be:

```csharp
public class Account : Entity<AccountId>
{
  public AccountNumber AccountNumber {get;}

  public Account(
    AccountId entityId,
    AccountNumber accountNumber)
    : base(entityId)
  {
      //do some model validation, null checks etc.
      AccountNumber = accountNumber;
  }
}
```

> When you look at the `Account` class/model definition above, you could describe it using object oriented programming language. That is, The `Account` class/model *is-an* `Entity<>` that *has-an* `AccountId`, and *has-an*  `AccountNumber`.
