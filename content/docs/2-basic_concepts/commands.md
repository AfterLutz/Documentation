Commands are basic `ValueObject`s that describe messages of intent that you want to perform in your domain, they represent the `C` side of `CQRS`. Commands are important because they are the *source of potential change* in the domain. Aggregate commands are sent to aggregate roots via aggregate managers. Typically, on successful execution, a command can result in one or more aggregate events being emitted.

As an example, imagine that you are implementing the command for initiating a bank transfer from one account to another. That command might look something like this:

```csharp
public class TransferMoneyCommand : Command<AccountAggregate, AccountId>
{
    public Money Amount { get; }
    public AccountId DestinationAccountId { get; }

    public TransferMoneyCommand(
        AccountId id,
        Money amount,
        AccountId destinationAccountId)
        : base(id)
    {
        Amount = amount;
        DestinationAccountId = destinationAccountId;
    }
}
```

> Note that the Money class is merely a `ValueObject`, created to hold the amount of money and to do basic validation. In Akkatecture, you don’t have to use the default Akkatecture `Command<,>` implementation to, you can create your own implementation, it merely have to implement the `ICommand<,>` interface.

A command by itself doesn’t do anything and will be swollowed by the underlying actor as unprocessed if no command handler exists for it, these messages go into the deadletter. To make a command work, you need to implement a command handler which is responsible for the processing of the command. To do this, just the implement `IExecute<>` interface on your aggregate. This interface registers a command handler to akka.nets persistent actors' `Command<T>()` handler registry.

```csharp
    public class AccountAggregate : AggregateRoot<AccountAggregate, AccountAggregateId, AccountState>,
        IExecute<TransferMoneyCommand>
    {
        public AccountAggregate(AccountAggregateId aggregateId)
            : base(aggregateId)
        {
        }

        public bool Execute(TransferMoneyCommand command)
        {
          if(State.Balance < command.Amount)
          {
            //Domain Error, not enough money to send
          }
          if(Id == command.DestinationAccountId)
          {
            //Domain Error, cant send money to yourself
          }

          Emit(new MoneyTransferedEvent(command.Amount, command.DestinationAccountId));

          //tell akkas underlying actor that you handled the command
          return true;
        }
    }
```

> Commands typically will be handled by first doing domain validation on the command against the aggregate state and then the corresponding event(e) would be emitted as a result of a successful command execution. In the above example, there are a few conditional statements that do basic domain validation on the command against the aggregate's state. This sort of pattern can be abstracted into `Specification<>`s. You can find out more about specifications in Akkatecture documentation [here](/docs/specifications).

## Ensure Idempotency

Detecting duplicate operations can be hard, especially if you have a distributed application, or simply a web application. Consider the following simplified scenario:

1. The user wants to send her friend money.
2. The user fills in the "send money form".
3. As the user is impatient, or by accident, the user submits the form twice.
4. The first web request completes, is validated, and the money is sent. However, as the browser is waiting on the first web request, this result is ignored.
5. The second web request either transfers money again since there is enough balance, or  throws a domain error as there is no more balance left in the account.
6. The user is presented with a error on the web page, or has accidently sent money twice when she only meant to send it once.

Since Akkatecture's by design dictates that aggregate roots exist as a singleton, we can deal with idempotency at the aggregate level.

We can redesign our command to look like this

```csharp
public class TransferMoneyCommand : Command<AccountAggregate, AccountId>
{
    public Money Amount { get; }
    public DestinationAccountId { get; }

    public TransferMoneyCommand(
        AccountId id,
        ISourceId sourceId,
        AccountId destinationAccountId,
        Money amount)
        : base(id, sourceId)
    {
        Amount = amount;
        DestinationAccountId = destinationAccountId;
    }
}
```

Note the use of the other `protected` constructor of `Command<,>` that takes a `ISourceId` in addition to the aggregate root identity. This `sourceId` can be supplied from outside the aggregate boundary eg the API surface.
You can then use a circular buffer or "list of processed" commands within your aggregate root to reject previously seen commands.

## Easier ISourceId Calculation
Ensuring the correct calculation of the command `ISourceId` can be somewhat cumbersome, which is why Akkatecture provides another base command you can use, the `DistinctCommand<,>`. By using the `DistinctCommand<,>` you merely have to implement the `GetSourceIdComponents()` and providing the `IEnumerable<byte[]>` that makes the command unique. The bytes is used to create a deterministic GUID to be used as an `ISourceId`.

```csharp
public class TransferMoneyCommand : DistinctCommand<AccountAggregate, AccountId>
{
    public Money Amount { get; }
    public DestinationAccountId { get; }

    public TransferMoneyCommand(
        AccountId id,
        AccountId destinationAccountId,
        Money amount)
        : base(id)
    {
        Amount = amount;
        DestinationAccountId = destinationAccountId;
    }

    protected override IEnumerable<byte[]> GetSourceIdComponents()
    {
      yield return Amount.GetBytes();
      yield return DestinationAccountId.GetBytes();
    }
}
```

> The `GetBytes()` method returns the `Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(...)` of the value object.

`DistinctCommand<,,>`s allows the aggregate to reject commands that it has already seen or processed. Akkatecture comes with a build in `CircularBuffer<>` implementation, and you can use the aggreggate root's `_previousSourceIds` member (which is a circular buffer of `SourceIds`) to keep track of the commands that have already been processed.
