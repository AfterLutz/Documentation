Lets tie up the loose ends so that we can run it. We need to orchestrate the startup of the actor system. Typically in Akkatecture this means instantiating:

* AggregateManagers
* AggregateSagaManagers
* DomainEventSubscribers
* Persistence Dependencies

The persistence dependencies is normally application specific. The `RevenueRepository` in this walkthrough is an implementation detail and will depend on your persistence requirements.

## Startup

We can make a method `CreateActorSystem()` that instantiates all the actors accordingly:

```csharp
//Walkthrough.Application.Program.cs
//Create actor system
var system = ActorSystem.Create("bank-system");

//Create aggregate manager for accounts
var aggregateManager = system.ActorOf(Props.Create(() => new AccountManager()),"account-manager");

//Create revenue repository
var revenueRepository = system.ActorOf(Props.Create(() => new RevenueRepository()),"revenue-repository");

//Create subscriber for revenue repository
system.ActorOf(Props.Create(() => new RevenueSubscriber(revenueRepository)),"revenue-subscriber");

//Create saga manager for money transfer
system.ActorOf(Props.Create(() =>
    new MoneyTransferSagaManager(() => new MoneyTransferSaga(aggregateManager))),"moneytransfer-saga");
```

## Example Usage

In our console application's `Main(...)` method:

```csharp
//Walkthrough.Application.Program.cs
//initialize actor system
CreateActorSystem();

//create send receiver identifiers
var senderId = AccountId.New;
var receiverId = AccountId.New;

//create mock opening balances
var senderOpeningBalance = new Money(509.23m);
var receiverOpeningBalance = new Money(30.45m);

//create commands for opening the sender and receiver accounts
var openSenderAccountCommand = new OpenNewAccountCommand(senderId, senderOpeningBalance);
var openReceiverAccountCommand = new OpenNewAccountCommand(receiverId, receiverOpeningBalance);

//send the command to be handled by the account aggregate
AccountManager.Tell(openReceiverAccountCommand);
AccountManager.Tell(openSenderAccountCommand);

//create command to initiate money transfer
var amountToSend = new Money(125.23m);
var transaction = new Transaction(senderId, receiverId, amountToSend);
var transferMoneyCommand = new TransferMoneyCommand(senderId,transaction);

//send the command to initiate the money transfer
AccountManager.Tell(transferMoneyCommand);

//fake 'wait' to let the saga process the chain of events
await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));

Console.WriteLine("Walkthrough operations complete.\n\n");
Console.WriteLine("Press Enter to get the revenue:");

Console.ReadLine();

//get the revenue stored in the repository
var revenue = RevenueRepository.Ask<RevenueProjection>(new GetRevenueQuery(), TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(500)).Result;

//print the results
Console.WriteLine($"The Revenue is: {revenue.Revenue.Value}.");
Console.WriteLine($"From: {revenue.Transactions} transaction(s).");

```

There we have our sample application working, congragulations for making it this far. Make sure to checkout the code and run the [walkthrough](https://github.com/Akkatecture/Walkthrough). A full example can be found in the repository.

## In Closing

Fantastic. You have finished the walkthrough. But don't stop there. Further your understanding by looking at some of the external resources that we have collected in [video](/docs/videos), and in [article](/docs/articles) form.
